=============

In caesar.c, the program encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. To review, Caesar’s cipher is a simple encryption technique in which each letter is replaced by another letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, for a shift of 3, the letter 'A' would be replaced by a 'D', 'B' replaced by 'E', and so on.
